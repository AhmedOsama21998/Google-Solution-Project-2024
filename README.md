Title: MPLANT
Slogan: Your Agricultural Guide.

Problem:

Some people may want to grow their crops but initially fear failure.
and Some farmers plant in incorrect ways, spoiling the soil and crops.

these two cases represent our problem which is represented by the fear of improper cultivation or cultivation, which will lead to crop failure, soil deterioration, or both.

Solution:
If we support those who want to start farming, and who are farming incorrectly, with an integrated system that monitors their crops and gives them immediate notifications of what the crops want in terms of nutrients and irrigation, we will have overcome the problem.

Our solution has two stages:

1- Seaeching stage:
We searched for the factors affecting on cultivation of some plants and proportions of these natural factors.

2- Technical implementation:
This consiats of two things: HW & SW.

HW module to sense some of the environment and soil factors affecting the plant. Talking into account the type of agriculture, whether hydroponic or otherwise. Sensors value uploded to real time data base on firebase.

The SW is mobile application developed using Flutter to link user interface with data base.
User will choose type of agriculture and take photo for the soil to determine the type of soil using Machine Learning model developed by us.
each user has unique ID in data base and will recive notifications about what he need to do to get better planting for his current crop. 
Also user films his plant every three days to identify plant diseases using machine learning model and how to treat them.

Finally, user find articles section wich consiats of reasearchs was Written by us reasearch Committee to learn user how to implant.

Sincerly.
